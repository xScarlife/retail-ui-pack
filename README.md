# Official xScarlife Gaming Retail UI package. 
This package contains all the addons I use in-game. Please make sure you follow the steps below before you continue making any changes. If you have any problems during installation or you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to ask for help in the Discord server, me and my moderators are happy to help where we can.

If you don't know how to install addons manually, please watch my video where I teach you how to do that by clicking this link: https://youtu.be/huUvI7O-6lE?t=83

Installation:
Open the .rar file and this will contain all the addons I use. You can simply drag and drop the folder over to your WoW Retail addons folder mostly located on your main C: drive like so, C:\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns.
