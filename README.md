### You are not allowed to share or upload this ElvUI profile to other sources or claim it to be your own without the creator's permission.

This package contains all the addons I use in-game. Please make sure you follow the steps below before you continue making any changes. If you have any problems during installation or you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to ask for help in the Discord server, me and my moderators are happy to help where we can.

If you don't know how to install addons manually, please watch my video where I teach you how to do that by clicking this link: https://youtu.be/huUvI7O-6lE?t=83

## Installation
Open the .rar file and this will contain all the addons I use. You can simply drag and drop the folder over to your WoW Retail addons folder mostly located on your main C: drive like so, C:\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns. 

Extra: If you can't open .rar files, you can download WinRAR here: https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0

Once you dragged and dropped the desired addon folders from the .rar file to your AddOns folder you can simply close all windows and launch your game. When on the character selection screen, please go to the lower left corner and select 'AddOns'. Make sure that all the addons you want to load in-game are checked or this can cause problems if you are missing one. 

Please note that you'll need to setup the addons how you like it. I cannot share my settings but if you need help, don't hesitate to ask.

## ElvUI
The main interface is ElvUI but this is not included in the addon package. Why? ElvUI makes the file size of this addon pack to large in order for me to upload it. You can copy my ElvUI import string by clicking this link: https://wago.io/gzOvW_2a4.

Due to the upload size restrictions I left out some AddOns that took to much space in the file itself. If you want you can download them manually from the links below.

1) [TradeSkillMaster](https://www.tradeskillmaster.com/install)
2) [Raider.IO](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/raiderio)
3) [Better Wardrobe](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/better-wardrobe-and-transmog)
4) [Weakauras](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2)

## Questions
### Where can I find the Details Import string?
This can be found on the Github page as a text file that you can copy over.

You can disable this by going to your UnitFrames - Individual Units - Player - Debuffs.

###  My health numbers are overlapping on the player frame. How do I fix this?
Go to the Unitframes -> Individual frames -> Player -> Custom Texts and remove the text format I wrote there.
